# FrontendCafe - CryptoCalculator

![Design preview for the CryptoCalculator](/design/desktop-preview.png)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

**To do this challenge, we need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Our challenge was to build out this calculator of cryptocurrencies it looking as close to the design as possible.

The only JavaScript we needed for this challenge is to consume the API when someone clicks the "calcular" icon, and for the spinner loader.

Our users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size

## Where to find everything

Our task was to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. We found both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to, and a Figma design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/XpSSBcnhVg1LBnRUhNAlUR/CryptoCalculator?node-id=0%3A1).

We keep all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.
## Deploying our project

We recommend using [Vercel](https://bit.ly/fem-vercel) as it's an amazing service and extremely simple to get set up with. If you'd like to use Vercel, here are some steps to follow to get started:

1. [Sign up to Vercel](https://bit.ly/fem-vercel-signup) and go through the onboarding flow, ensuring your GitHub account is connected by using their [Vercel for GitHub](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-github) integration.
2. Connect your project to Vercel from the ["Import project" page](https://vercel.com/import), using the "From Git Repository" button and selecting the project you want to deploy.
3. Once connected, every time you `git push`, Vercel will create a new [deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/platform/deployments) and the deployment URL will be shown on your [Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard). You will also receive an email for each deployment with the URL.
